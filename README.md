## Project Description:
Regardless of the project, a README file is always necessary to give an overview of a project. The problem? Making one can be inconvenient. This tool aims to simplify that process by allowing the developer to create a README.md file from the integrated terminal. 

To complete this task, this tool uses: 
* JavaScript
* Inquirer 8.2.4

This project has been completed when:
